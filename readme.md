## About

The goal of this configuration is to enable users without experience with cs servers to host one for pracs, scrims and matches. This project uses [MetaMod, SourceMod and multiple SM Plugins](docs/addons.md). After following the [installation](docs/install.md) the server can be controlled with many [commands](docs/commands.md) in the chat. There are also some [customizations](docs/customizations.md) that can be used to customize the config.
